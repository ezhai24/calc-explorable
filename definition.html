    <h1>The Definition</h1>
    <h2>Slopes</h2>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="descContainer">
        <div id="slopestep_1" class="step">
          Let's start simple. Given two points, can you calculate the slope?
          <input id="answer_1" type="text">
          <button id="check_1">Check</button>
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_2" class="step hidden">
          <p id="feedback_2"></p> The slope of a line, denoted by \(m\), is given by the formula
          $$m = \frac{\textrm{change in y}}{\textrm{change in x}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$
          So in this case the slope is 2.
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_3" class="step hidden">
          Given this defintion, it should be apparent that changing the position of the coordinates 
          changes the slope. Try moving the points around and watch how the slope changes!
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_4" class="step hidden">
          Okay. Now let's get a little crazy. We'll reset the points and draw a curve through them.
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_5" class="step hidden">
          Can you calculate the slope between the two points on the curve?
          <input id="answer_5" type="text">
          <button id="check_5">Check</button>
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_6" class="step hidden">
          <p id="feedback_6"></p> The slope of the line, is still 2!
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_7" class="step hidden">
          You can still move the points around too. Try it! You may notice there's a bit of a difference.
          The points can only move along the curve now. That's because in order for us to  say we're 
          calculating the slope between two points on the curve, the two points must stay on the curve.
          Pretty intuitive right?
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_8" class="step hidden">
          Now try moving the points really reeaaallly close together until they're on top of each other.
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_9" class="step hidden">
          ... looks like we broke the code... When both points have the same coordinates, the slope works 
          out to be \(\frac{0}{0}\) which is ???? but I'll get back to that later. First, we need to take 
          a short detour.

        <div id="slopeFormula" class="hidden">
          $$m = \frac{9.0-1.0}{5.0-1.0} = 2.0$$

    <h2>Limits</h2>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="descContainer">
        <div id="limitstep_1" class="step">
          There's a lot of complexity and nuance to limits but we're not going to worry about that here. All we 
          need to understand is the basic idea which is, lucky for you, incredibly simple.
        </div>
        <div id="limitstep_2" class="step hidden">
          To help explain we'll start with just one point this time. Try moving the circle closer to the X. 
          What happens?
        </div>
        <div id="limitstep_3" class="step hidden">
          The closer the circle gets to the X, the bluer it! And once the circle reaches the X, it's completely 
          blue! We can express this sentiment more formally by saying "The limit of the color, as the circle 
          approaches the X, is blue" and write it mathematically like so:
          $$\lim_{circle \to X} color(circle) = blue$$
          <i>
            Note: we write color(circle) because color is a function of the position of the circle. In other 
            words, the color of the circle depends on it's position.
          </i>       
        </div>
        <div id="limitstep_4" class="step hidden">
          And that's a limit! Limits aren't actually mathematical by nature. They just describe a variable
          and the value it approaches as some other variable it depends on approaches another value.

    <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="descContainer">
        <div id="defstep_1" class="step">
          Alright. Let's get back to that broken code. We still need figure out what the slope of the line 
          between the two points on the curve are as one point gets reeaaallly close the other point.
        </div>
        <div id="defstep_2" class="step hidden">
          First things first, I'm adding two vertical lines to help you see the x positions of the points a 
          little better. You'll notice that as the x positions get closer, the points get closer as well. 
          Nothing you didn't already know but give a try anyway!
        </div>
        <div id="defstep_3" class="step hidden">
          Can you see where this is going? Now we can rephrase our original question "What is the slope of the
          line as one point gets reeaaallly close to the other point?" as "What is the limit of the slope of 
          the line as one point approaches the other?". We can write that out mathematically as:
          $$\lim_{x_2 \to x_1} \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$
        </div>
        <div id="defstep_4" class="step hidden">
          Now if we rewrite the limit this time calling \(x_2\) just x, \(x_1\) a, and using function notation...
          $$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$
          ...viola! We have the definition of a derivative!
        </div>
        <div id="defstep_5" class="step hidden">
          Equivalently, we can let h denote the distance between the two x positions and rewrite the limit as
          $$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x) - f(x+h)}{h}$$
          which is an alternative definition of a derivative.
        </div>
        <div id="defstep_6" class="step hidden">
          So a derivate is really just special slope - a slope at a single point on a curve. And if slopes relate
          the changes in two variables, then a derivative relates the changes in two variables at a single instant.
