    <h2>Slopes</h2>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="descContainer">
        <div id="slopestep_1" class="step">
          Let's start simple. Given two points, can you calculate the slope?
          <input id="answer_1" type="text">
          <button id="check_1">Check</button>
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_2" class="step hidden">
          <p id="feedback_2"></p> The slope of a line, denoted by \(m\), is given by the formula
          $$m = \frac{\textrm{change in y}}{\textrm{change in x}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$
          So in this case the slope is 2.
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_3" class="step hidden">
          Given this defintion, it should be apparent that changing the position of the coordinates 
          changes the slope. Try moving the points around and watch how the slope changes!
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_4" class="step hidden">
          Ok. Now let's get a little crazy. We'll reset the points and run a curve through them.
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_5" class="step hidden">
          Can you calculate the slope between the two points on the curve?
          <input id="answer_5" type="text">
          <button id="check_5">Check</button>
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_6" class="step hidden">
          <p id="feedback_6"></p> The slope of the line, is still 2!
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_7" class="step hidden">
          You can still move the points around too. Try it! You may notice there's a bit of a difference.
          The points can only move along the curve now. That's because in order for us to  say we're 
          calculating the slope between two points on the curve, the two points must stay on the curve.
          Pretty intuitive right?
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_8" class="step hidden">
          Now try moving the points really reeaaallly close together until they're on top of each other.
        </div>
        <div id="slopestep_9" class="step hidden">
          ... looks like we broke the code... but I'll get back to that. First, we need to take a short detour.
        </div>
        <button id="nextSlopeStep" class="hidden">Next</button>
      </div>

      <div class="vizContainer">
        <svg id="slopeGraph"></svg>
        <div id="slopeFormula" class="hidden">
          $$m = \frac{9.0-1.0}{5.0-1.0} = 2.0$$
        </div>
      </div>

    <h2>Limits</h2>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="descContainer">
        <div id="limitstep_1" class="step">
          There's a lot of complexity and nuance to limits but we're not going to worry about that here. All we 
          need to understand is the basic idea which is, lucky for you, incredibly simple.
        </div>
        <div id="limitstep_2" class="step hidden">
          To help explain we'll start with just one point this time. Try moving the circle closer to the X.
        </div>
        <div id="limitstep_3" class="step hidden">
          The closer the circle gets to the X, the bluer it gets! We can express this sentiment more formally 
          by saying "The limit of the color, as the circle approaches the X, is blue" and write it mathematically 
          like so:
          $$\lim_{circle \to X} color(circle) = blue$$
          <i>
            Note: we write color(circle) because color is a function of the position of the circle. In other 
            words, the color of the circle depends on it's position.
          </i>
          <div class="break"></div>
          And that's a limit! Limits aren't actually mathematical by nature. They just describe a variable
          and the value it approaches as some other variable it depends on approaches another value.
